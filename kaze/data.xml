	<description>
	The player takes control of a Glider (specialised small plane) and attempt to shoot down the enemies in his way throughout various levels. As the player complete levels, more will become available. The player will be able to upgrade his Glider in a multitude of ways as enemies become more powerful. Each level will house a level boss and the level will only be cleared after this boss is defeated. Levels will be replayable, with scores for each level being recorded to a high score leaderboard (not available as of yet). The only level currently available is the test level with one type of enemy and one ammo pickup.
